title: Secret Agents â€” Volunteer Notes
---

#Introduction:
In this proect, club members will learn how to create a simple code using a one-time-pad, encode short messages with it, and decode them.

#Resources
For this project, Scratch 2 should be used. Scratch 2 can either be used online at [jumpto.cc/scratch-on](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-on) or can be downloaded from [jumpto.cc/scratch-off](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-off) and used offline.

You can find a completed version of this project <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/114265027/#editor">online</a>, or it can be downloaded by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

+ SecretAgents.sb2

This link also includes a 'Project Resources' folder, which contains a starting Scratch model to save some time getting started. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources.

#Learning Objectives
+ Variables;
+ Lists;
+ Random numbers;
+ Loops;
+ Counters;
+ Subroutines (using broadcast messages).

#Challenges

+ "Encoding a Short Message" - A discussion about how to encode a few letters using the one time pad by hand.

+ "How do you Decode the Gibberish?" - A thought about the decoding will work.

+ "Making Sense of Decoded Messages" - As spaces and symbols are not allowed, the decoded message needs to be split into words.

+ "Security of a One Time Pad Code" - Which of these matters if they are found by the enemy? The radio or the One-Time-Pad?

+ "More than 10 Letters in a Message?" - What happens when you type a message more than 10 letters long. How can you allow for larger messages?

#Frequently Asked Questions
None at the moment.
