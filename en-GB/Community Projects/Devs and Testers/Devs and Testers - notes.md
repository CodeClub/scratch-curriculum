#Introduction:
This is a group activity, for a small group of five students, who have completed a good range of Scratch projects, or their own equivalent projects. The group will be divided into two teams (Developers and Testers), that work together to improve an existing Scratch project; finding and fixing bugs, and suggesting and implementing improvements (features). With more students, it can be run with multiple groups in parallel. You just need to make sure you have have enough whiteboards and cards for each group. See the FAQ section below for more information on alternatives for these.

The project code can be distributed by remixing if the students have online Scratch accounts, or distributed via shared folders or a USB key, if they work offline. Remember to keep a copy of the original project in a safe place, for reference and final merging, and in case things get overwhelming.

#Resources
For this project, Scratch 2 should be used. Scratch 2 can either be used online at [jumpto.cc/scratch-on](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-on) or can be downloaded from [jumpto.cc/scratch-off](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-off) and used offline.

Project resources:
+ A whiteboard for each pair of teams
+ A pile of cards with lines, for the Testers to raise bugs and new features, and to be used by the Developers team to track the progress when implementing fixes and new features to their project.

#Learning Objectives
The following skill will be taught in this project:

+ Written and spoken communication of technical concepts;
+ Collaboration using team roles;
+ Understanding of issue tracking concept, with task ownership, and progressing a bug/feature through the development cycle of acceptance/progress/testing/completion, versioning; and
+ Management of multiple code updates (this will be in the challenge);
+ Prioritisation of tasks, and [improving efficiency.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban)

#Challenges
+ "Merge new fixes and features to create release a new version" - The challenge will be to combine all the fixes and features into the original project, test them, and then release a new version. It should be possible to create a simple [changelog document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changelog), which lists all the bugs fixed and new features added.
+ Students can be rotated into different teams, either when a bug or feature has been completed, or once a new version challenge has been completed. 

#Frequently Asked Questions
+ What if I don't have access to a whiteboard? Any board can be used, since it is just three columns, to allow the Developers team to 'accept' a bug or feature, and then move it into the next column, until it gets to the completion stage and is considered 'closed'. This could be done with a disposable cardboard sheet, or even a pinboard (just use masking tape for lines and labels, instead of whiteboard marker). An online method could be to create a Trello account or similar, with clear instructions on what information is not to be entered online.

+ What happens if a student is not able to successfully implement a bug fix or feature implementation? This happens in real projects too. If a bug fix or feature is not deemed workable or a high priority, it should be marked as such and can be closed. In such a case, a discussion between the tester and developer should occur, and is a good opportunity for students to learn to learn and communicate what constitutes a valid bug or feature. It may be the case that a bug is deemed acceptable, or working as designed, in which case it can be closed as well. This can also help students determine whether they have sufficient skills to implement a bug/feature. However, in most cases, it is probably a good exercise to at least try, if the bug/feature is decided to be viable.

+ How long does this activity go? This activity can be short term i.e. one session, or long-term i.e. over the course of a few sessions, depending on the skill levels of students.

+ Can I apply this project to other languages? This would work fine with other languages such as Python. Just be aware that versioning and keeping track of more complex projects can be difficult.
