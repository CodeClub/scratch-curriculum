# Introduction { .intro}
We are going to make a game of catch with __Felix the cat__ and __Herbert__ the mouse. You control Herbert with the mouse and try to avoid getting caught by Felix. The longer you avoid him the more points you score, but don’t get caught because your score will go down!

## Activity Checklist { .check}

1. Change Felix’s script to be this:

    ```blocks
        
        when FLAG clicked
        forever
            point towards [mouse-pointer]
            move (10) steps
            next costume
            play (drum 62) for (0.3) beats
            if <touching [Herbert]?> then
                say [Caught you!] for (1) secs
    ```

## Test Your Project { .flag}
__Click the green flag.__

Does Felix say when he’s caught Herbert?

## Save your project { .save}

# STEP 4: Herbert turns into a ghost when he’s caught { .activity}

__Instead of Felix saying something, we want Herbert to turn into a ghost when he’s caught.__

## Activity Checklist { .check}

+ Change Felix’s script to send this message when he catches Herbert.

    ```blocks
        
        when FLAG clicked
        forever
            point towards [mouse-pointer]
            move (10) steps
            next costume
            play drum (62) for (0.3) beats
            if <touching [Herbert]?> then
                broadcast [caught]
                play drum (58) for (0.2) beats
                wait (1) sec
    ```
+ Import a new costume into Herbert from fantasy/ghost2-a.
+ Edit the costume to make it smaller.
Six clicks on the shrink button should do.
+ Change the names of Herbert’s
costumes so the mouse costume is
called ‘alive’ and the ghost costume is called ‘dead’.
+ Create a new script for Herbert to turn him into a ghost:

    ```blocks
        
        when I receive [caught]
        switch to costume [dead]
        wait (0.5) secs
        switch to costume [alive]
    ```
	
## Test Your Project { .flag}
__Click the green flag.__

Does Herbert turn into a ghost when he’s caught?
Does Felix play the right sounds at the right time?
Does Felix still stay still for long enough for Herbert to get away

## Save your project { .save}

# STEP 5: Keep score { .activity}

__Let’s add a score so we know how well we do at keeping Herbert alive.
We’ll start the score at zero and increase it by one every second. If Felix catches Herbert, we’ll reduce the score by one hundred.__

## Activity Checklist { .check}

+ Make a variable, for all sprites, called score. Click on Variables in the top menu, make a variable and name it score
+ On the stage, create these two scripts

    ```blocks
        
        when FLAG clicked
        set score to (0)
        forever
            change score by (1)
            wait (1) secs
        when I receive [caught]
        change score by (-100)
    ```
	
## Test Your Project { .flag}
__Click the green flag.__

Does the score go up by one every second?
Does the score go down by one hundred when Herbert is caught?
What happens when Herbert is caught before score reaches one hundred? Does the score go back to zero when you start a new game?
