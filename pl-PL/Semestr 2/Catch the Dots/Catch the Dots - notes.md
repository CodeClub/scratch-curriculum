#Learning Objectives
+ This project consolidates learning of previous programming skills learnt.

#Challenges
+ "Spinning left" - creating code to move the controller;
+ "More dots" - creating more coloured dots that need to match the correct part of the controller';
+ "Faster moving dots" - using a variable to increase the speed of the dots throughout the game;
+ "Improve your game!" - adding new dots that manipulate the `score` {.blockdata}, `delay` {.blockdata} and `speed` {.blockdata} variables;
+ "Game menu" - creating a menu, with various stage backgrounds and buttons for moving between them.
